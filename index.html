<h1 id="title"> A World War 1 Interview </h1>
<h3>By Aahan Raval</h3>
<hr>
<p>World War 1 was a very historical event which was kickstarted by a series of other events, most notably the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. This website is made by me for a school project. Anyways though,whether you're a history buff, or someone just looking for information on the web aout World War 1, I hope you will enjoy this website! (NOTE: This probably won't answer all your questions about World War 1, but oh well! I mean, I'm not a veteran, after all, but I've read the Peanuts comic strip before! Very informative comic strip! I still hope you like this project, at it has been hard work!)</p>

<h2 id="section_1">Deep in the Trenches</h2>
<p>The trenches were playing a major part in World War 1, so it's no wonder that I have to answer questions about that.  These pigsties were where most people fought for their country.</p>
<h4 id="q1">Question 1. What were trenches?</h4>
<p>Trenches were <b>gigantic ditches</b> that were dug into the ground that served some <b>protection</b>. Armies <b>commonly</b> fought in these trenches. Underneath this paragraph is a picture of an army seemingly planning an attack.</p> <a href="https://cdn.britannica.com/49/135149-050-D6B8878A/troops-British-trench-Western-Front-World-War.jpg?w=600&q=60"><img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/49/135149-050-D6B8878A/troops-British-trench-Western-Front-World-War.jpg?w=600&q=60" width="15%" align="right"></a>
<h4 id="q2">Question 2. What was life like in the trenches?</h4>
<p>It was <b>messy</b> and <b>nerve-wracking</b>. Just hearing a gunshot could mean the difference between life and death. To make a long paragraph short, you probably couldn't wait to go back to the comfort of your own house.</p>
<h4 id="q3">Question 3. What did the soldiers eat in the trenches?</h4>
<p>Some foods that most soldiers ate were <b>canned food</b>, <b>meat</b> such as beef and lamb, <b>war bread</b>, made with wheat substitutes, <b>tea</b>, which removed the taste of water and was comforting, and <b>cheese</b>, which was sometimes used as a meat substitute. The picture to the bottom right shows an army having some tea time before the next attack.</p>

</a>
<h4 id="q4">Question 4. How would the soldiers sleep in trenches?</h4>
<p>Soldiers residing in trenches would usually sleep in <b>small hollow holes</b> that were dug in the <b>side of the trench</b>.</p>
<h4 id="q5">Question 5. How did the soldiers communicate with family at home?</h4>
<p>The soldiers usually communicated with friends and family at home by <b>writing</b> letters and <b>sending</b> them via <b>postal service</b>.</p>
<h4 id="q6"> Question 6. What do you think would have made trenches a difficult place to live?</h4>
<p>There were many <b>pests and bugs</b> in the trenches, and you could catch many <b>diseases</b> such as <b>trench foot</b>, which(to me) is too <b>greusome</b> to describe. Also, an attack from the <b>enemy</b> could <b>strike</b> at <b>any moment</b>! I know all this would make me high-strung!</p>

</a>
<h4 id="q7">Question 7. What time of day was it dangerous to be living in the trenches, and why?</h4>
<p><b>Nighttime</b>, because that was when most <b>surprise attacks</b> like <b>raids</b> or <b>bomb attacks</b>, (as shown in the picture next to the paragraph) were commenced, and there were many <b>patrols</b> on duty.</p>

<h2 id="section_2">Animals in the War</h2>
<p>Animals played a very important role in World War 1, which will be shown in these next 2 questions(I know, this section is very short, sorry).</p>
<h4 id="q8">Question 8. What animals did they use in the war?</h4>
<p>Some animals they used include <b>dogs, horses, monkeys, camels, and pigeons</b>.</p>

<h4 id="q9">Question 9. What did they use animals for in the war?</h4>
<p>They used <b>dogs</b> to <b>provide medical equipment</b> to <b>wounded soldiers</b>, and <b>lay telephone wires</b>(a picture of medical-equipment dogs lining up is shown above), <b>horses</b> for <b>travel</b> and <b>bringing equipment</b> around (as shown above), <b>monkeys</b> as a <b>mascot</b> and for <b>warning for enemy soldiers</b>, <b>camels</b> for <b>carrying bruised soldiers</b>(also as shown above), and <b>pigeons</b> for <b>carrying messages</b>.</p>
<h4 id="q10">Question 10. How did they heal the animals?</h4>
<p>The British recognised the <b>usefulness</b> of its <b>animals</b> and made <b>special hospitals</b> for them. The overall <b>recovery rate</b> for animals nursed in vets was <b>80%</b>. </p>
